My student number is au688214 and so I have been given project number 14.

This is a project to create a cubic sub-spline for data with derivitives which is an Akima sub-spline. 

I am happy to be doing the splines again as when I started my coding ability was much poorer than now and so I will have the chnace to revisit that topic and see to what extent I have improved.
