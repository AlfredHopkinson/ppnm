My student number is au688214 and so I have been given project number 14. It turns out this isnt my student number. My number is 202100006 but Dmitri has said it doesnt matter and I can continue with this one.

Project:
This is a project to create a cubic sub-spline for data with derivitives with the example of an Akima sub-spline. 

Overview:
In this exam I have coded the functions and most of everything else in the main.c file as this made it easier for me. The spline.c was when I started and was figurinmg out the Akima sub-spline so isnt relevent for the exam particuarly. The Latex document is called report.pdf and details what I have done in much more detail I recomend this to be viewed first. For more detail I have done more graphs that dont feature in the report which all show various different things I did to test and show the sub-spline worked.

Initial thoughts:
I am happy to be doing the splines again as when I started my coding ability was much poorer than now and so I will have the chnace to revisit that topic and see to what extent I have improved.

Concluding thoughts:
I am very pleased with how I did in this project as it has showed that even though I have found some parts very difficult my coding ability has improved massively. I think I will be using coding techniques such as this in the future, especially the latex and graphical elements. I wished I could have done the final part but with the time contraints this was very difficult.

Self Evaluation: 7/10 - no inital C experiance but managed to do more in the course than I thought and I enjoyed it.
